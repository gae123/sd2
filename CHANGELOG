## [0.21.2] - 2020-09-19
### Added
- sd2: A new option images.<<image>>.startup_script. When the container
  starts this script is executed. A good place to run the standard entrypoint.sh
  and install additional packages. If you use this option --entrypoint 
  must not be used.
- sd2: In config images.image section, before a container image is started 
  all `{sd2ContainerName}` references
  are expanded to the name of the container being instantiated
- sd2: In config `images.image.docker_auth`  
  is now deprecated in favor of `images.image.run_before`
### Fixed
- entrypoint.sh: Fixed an issue that was causing startup to stop in ubuntu
  images that did not already have ssh installed.

## [0.21.1] - 2020-09-09
### Added
- sd2: pylint for python 3 compatibility issues to make transition to python3 easier
